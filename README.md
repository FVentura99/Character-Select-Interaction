# Character-Select-Interaction

This project focuses on the character selection in fighting games. Taking inspiration from games like Granblue Fantasy VS and MK, this also includes an interaction between two characters chosen.

Features:
1) Allow user to choose their characters
2) Provide a special interaction after choosing characters if defined.
3) Provide general interaction if not.

Upcoming changes:
1) Find a way to create a clone interaction between two of the same characters.
2) Provide a stage selector and interactions in specific stages. (e.g. Ryu in Forgotten waterfall in street fighter 5)
3) Fix the interaction to where it will provide the same interaction. (e.g. if Ken is picked first before Ryu but provides same interaction when selecting Ryu first)
